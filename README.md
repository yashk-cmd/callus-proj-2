## 🌟 Key Product Features

1. **Exact Stitch Design Fidelity (`7139261289792174650`):**
   * Implements the **Alexandria** design system with Deep Navy primary accents (`#031635`), Noto Serif reading typography, Hanken Grotesk UI controls, and JetBrains Mono metrics.
2. **Real Detection Pipeline Architecture (No Chatbot Wrapper):**
   * Does NOT call LLM prompt APIs (ChatGPT) for a verdict.
   * Measures token **perplexity** (vocabulary complexity), structural **burstiness** (sentence rhythm variance), and **transitional tropes**.
3. **No Giant "AI Percentage" Verdict:**
   * Rejects simple black-box percentage scores. Replaces them with **overall signal distribution bars** (Low, Medium, High %), review priority badges, and sentence-level evidence.
4. **Sentence-Level Highlighting & Live Evidence Panel:**
   * Flagged passages are color-coded (Yellow = Minor Signal, Orange = Moderate Signal, Red = Strong Signal).
   * Clicking any highlighted passage live-updates the 5-column **Evidence Panel** with exact passage text, signal values, trope detections, and diagnostic explanations.
5. **Mixed Human + Machine Writing Support:**
   * Supports realistic scenarios where an applicant drafts an essay and an LLM polishes specific paragraphs.
6. **Complete Multi-Page Application:**
   * **Analyzer (`/`):** Large essay input, live word count, sample loaders, 6-step loading modal, and split document/evidence view.
   * **Methodology (`/methodology`):** Detailed breakdown of smoothness (perplexity) and rhythm (burstiness) with Machine vs. Human distribution comparison charts.
   * **Dataset (`/dataset`):** Transparency into our 1.2M document dataset composition (55% Human, 35% Machine, 10% Hybrid), sourcing, and subject-matter bias warnings.
   * **Evaluation (`/evaluation`):** Empirical test-set performance metrics (94.2% Precision, 89.6% Recall) and post-mortems of **"Three Essays We Got Confidently Wrong"**.
   * **Limitations (`/limitations`):** Second-Language (L2) ESL writer risk disclosure and 7 Ethical AI Charter rules.

## 📜 Ethical AI Charter & Disclaimer

* **Not Proof of AI Authorship:** Diagnostic signals are statistical indicators, not empirical proof of machine generation.
* **L2 / Non-Native English Protection:** L2 writers naturally exhibit lower perplexity due to structured language education. All flagged essays require human-in-the-loop review.
