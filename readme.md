VeritasAI

Statistical Admissions Essay Diagnostics

VeritasAI is a backend-driven admissions essay analysis platform designed to provide statistical writing diagnostics rather than claiming to determine whether a person or an AI wrote a document.

The system analyzes submitted essays at the sentence level and combines multiple measurable signals, including:

Vocabulary smoothness / perplexity

Sentence rhythm / burstiness

Formulaic phrasing

Lexical predictability

Vocabulary diversity

Repeated-word behavior

Repeated n-gram behavior

The result is presented as an evidence-oriented diagnostic report with sentence-level scores, signal categories, review priority, and an overall signal distribution.

Important: VeritasAI is a statistical diagnostic system. It does not establish human or AI authorship with certainty.

Features

1. Sentence-Level Analysis

VeritasAI preserves submitted sentence text and analyzes each sentence independently.

Each sentence receives:

Sentence ID

Sentence index

Paragraph index

Original sentence text

Overall signal score

Primary diagnostic category

Individual signal evidence

Summary explanation

Example:

s3
Eventually, I learned that understanding why something breaks
can be more valuable than simply making it work.

2. Vocabulary Smoothness

VeritasAI uses a local language model to calculate token-level perplexity.

This signal provides information about how predictable or variable the wording is under the selected language model.

The system does not interpret low or moderate perplexity as proof of AI authorship.

3. Sentence Rhythm / Burstiness

The system compares sentence lengths across the essay.

It considers:

Sentence word count

Essay-level sentence-length distribution

Coefficient of variation

Sentence rhythm variation

This helps identify unusually uniform or unusual sentence-length patterns.

4. Formulaic Phrasing

VeritasAI checks configured phrases and patterns that may represent common transitional or academic phrasing.

This signal is supplementary evidence.

A formulaic phrase by itself does not indicate machine-generated writing.

5. Lexical Predictability

The system evaluates lexical behavior using features such as:

Type-token ratio / vocabulary diversity

Repeated content-word ratio

Repeated trigram ratio

These measurements provide additional statistical evidence about vocabulary variety and repetition.

6. Evidence-Based Results

Each analyzed sentence can contain multiple diagnostic signals.

A signal includes:

id
category
title
metricValue
flagLevel
description

This allows the frontend to explain why a passage received a particular score instead of displaying only a single unexplained number.

7. Review Priority

The document receives an overall review priority based on sentence-level flag levels.

Possible signal levels are:

none
yellow
orange
red

The document-level distribution reports:

lowPct
mediumPct
highPct
normalPct

Architecture

VeritasAI uses a layered architecture:

Important modules

app/main.py

Creates the FastAPI application, configures CORS, registers routes, and exposes the health endpoint.

app/api/routes.py

Contains HTTP endpoints.

The analysis endpoint is:

POST /api/analyze

app/analysis/text.py

Responsible for:

Text normalization

Sentence boundary detection

Sentence extraction

Word tokenization

Paragraph indexing

Basic document statistics

A key design requirement is that sentence text is taken directly from normalized source text rather than reconstructed by joining tokens.

app/analysis/pipeline.py

Coordinates the complete analysis:

raw essay
    ↓
sentence extraction
    ↓
document statistics
    ↓
per-sentence analysis
    ↓
signal generation
    ↓
combined scoring
    ↓

AnalysisResult

app/analysis/perplexity.py

Calculates language-model perplexity and produces the associated signal.

app/analysis/features.py

Calculates lexical features.

app/analysis/tropes.py

Detects configured formulaic phrases.

app/analysis/evidence.py

Builds diagnostic evidence and explanations.

app/models.py

Defines Pydantic request and response models.

How the Analysis Works

Step 1 — Input Validation

The API accepts an essay through:

{
  "essay": "...",
  "model_id": "custom"
}

Empty essays are rejected.

Very short essays are also rejected because they do not provide enough observations for meaningful document-level statistical interpretation.

The current minimum is:

20 words

Step 2 — Text Normalization

The input is normalized without intentionally removing spaces inside sentences.

The normalization process handles:

CRLF line endings

CR line endings

Non-breaking spaces

Leading/trailing line whitespace

Repeated blank lines

The sentence text is then extracted from direct character slices of the normalized document.

Step 3 — Sentence Boundary Detection

Sentence boundaries are detected using punctuation such as:

.
!
?

followed by whitespace or the end of the document.

Sentence spans are then used to obtain the actual sentence text.

This prevents the sentence output from being reconstructed from tokenized words.

Step 4 — Sentence Features

For every sentence, VeritasAI calculates several independent signals.

Conceptually:

Sentence
   │
   ├── Perplexity
   ├── Burstiness
   ├── Formulaic phrases
   └── Lexical predictability

Step 5 — Combined Score

The independent signals are combined into a sentence-level score.

The score is constrained to:

0.0 → 1.0

The result is then assigned a flag level according to the project's configured thresholds.

Step 6 — Document Classification

After all sentences are analyzed, VeritasAI calculates:

Signal distribution

Review priority

Reading time

Complexity

Summary message

The final object is returned as an AnalysisResult.

Environment Verification

Before starting the server, verify that Python is coming from .venv.

macOS

which python
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

Windows

where.exe python
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

If the result points to a system installation instead of .venv, fix the environment before continuing.

macOS alias issue

If the shell reports something such as:

python: aliased to /usr/bin/python3

run:

unalias python
hash -r

Then:

which python
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

Running the Backend

From the backend directory with .venv activated:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

The API will be available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

Example Response Structure

The API returns an object similar to:

{
  "id": "VER-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "title": "Admissions Essay Analysis",
  "processedAt": "2026-08-12 16:45 UTC",
  "rawText": "Essay text...",
  "wordCount": 51,
  "sentenceCount": 4,
  "readingTimeMinutes": 1,
  "analysisComplexity": "Low",
  "reviewPriority": "LOW",
  "distribution": {
    "lowPct": 0,
    "mediumPct": 0,
    "highPct": 0,
    "normalPct": 100
  },
  "sentences": [],
  "summaryMessage": "..."
}

Each sentence contains:

{
  "id": "s0",
  "index": 0,
  "paragraphIndex": 0,
  "text": "I have always been fascinated by technology.",
  "flagLevel": "none",
  "signalScore": 0.0,
  "passageCategory": "smoothness",
  "signals": [],
  "summaryExplanation": "..."
}

Signal Framework

VeritasAI currently uses four major diagnostic groups.

1. Smoothness

Based primarily on language-model perplexity.

Example:

Vocabulary Smoothness
Perplexity: 44.85

The system treats this as statistical evidence, not authorship proof.

2. Burstiness

Measures sentence rhythm and sentence-length variation.

Example:

Sentence Rhythm
1.14 / 10 (CV 0.285)

A sentence is evaluated relative to the essay's sentence-length distribution.

3. Tropes

Detects configured formulaic phrases.

Example:

Formulaic Phrasing
0 detected

This is supplementary evidence and should not be interpreted independently.

4. Predictability

Uses lexical measurements such as:

TTR
repeated content-word ratio
repeated trigram ratio

Example:

TTR 0.86 | repetition 0.167

Flag Levels

The system uses:

none
yellow
orange
red

These represent increasing levels of statistical signal under the configured thresholds.

They should not be described to users as:

human
AI
definitely AI
definitely human

The correct interpretation is:

statistical evidence requiring different levels of review

Scoring and Review Priority

The sentence score is represented as a floating-point value:

0.0 → 1.0

The score is based on multiple independent signals.

The document then aggregates sentence-level flag levels to calculate a distribution.

Example:

Low Signal        4%
Medium Signal     0%
High Signal       0%
Natural/Unflagged 96%

The exact interpretation depends on the project's configured thresholds.

Testing

1. Syntax Test

python -m py_compile app/analysis/pipeline.py

You can also compile the text-processing module:

python -m py_compile app/analysis/text.py

2. Pipeline Test

python test_pipeline.py

A successful test should preserve sentence text.

For example:

s0 'I have always been fascinated by technology.'
s1 'When I was younger, I built small projects with whatever materials I could find.'
s2 'One experiment failed repeatedly, but the failure taught me to approach problems differently.'
s3 'Eventually, I learned that understanding why something breaks can be more valuable than simply making it work.'

3. API Test

Start the server:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Then:

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

And test:

curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-binary @request.json

Sentence Preservation Test

Sentence text should be preserved exactly through the pipeline.

A useful test is:

from app.analysis.text import extract_sentences

essay = (
    "Eventually, I learned that understanding why something "
    "breaks can be more valuable than simply making it work."
)

sentences = extract_sentences(essay)

print(repr(sentences[0].text))
print("understanding why" in sentences[0].text)
print("understandingwhy" in sentences[0].text)

Expected:

True
False

The system should preserve:

understanding why

rather than:

understandingwhy

Frontend Integration

The frontend should send the essay to:

POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze

with:

{
  "essay": "...",
  "model_id": "custom"
}

The frontend can then render:

Document ID
Word Count
Sentence Count
Review Priority
Signal Distribution
Sentence Diagnostics

Each sentence can be displayed as an expandable diagnostic passage.

CORS

The FastAPI application currently allows local frontend development origins such as:

http://localhost:3000
http://127.0.0.1:3000

This allows the frontend development server to communicate with the backend.

For production deployment, configure the allowed origins for the actual deployed frontend domain rather than leaving development origins as the only configuration.

Troubleshooting

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

First check:

which python
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

Then:

python -m pip show torch

The Python executable must point to:

backend/.venv/

If necessary, use the environment interpreter directly on macOS:

.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Windows:

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

source venv/bin/activate fails

The project uses:

.venv

Use:

source .venv/bin/activate

not:

source venv/bin/activate

Port 8000 is already in use

macOS

lsof -nP -iTCP:8000 -sTCP:LISTEN

Then kill the numeric PID:

kill -9 <PID>

Windows

netstat -ano | findstr :8000

Then:

taskkill /PID <PID> /F

Transformers warning

You may see:

loss_type=None was set in the config but it is unrecognised.
Using the default loss: ForCausalLMLoss.

If analysis still completes successfully, this is a Transformers configuration warning rather than a Python import failure.

It should be cleaned up before a production release so logs remain clean and the model configuration is explicit.

Development Workflow

Recommended workflow:

1. Activate .venv
        ↓
2. Install/update requirements
        ↓
3. Run syntax checks
        ↓
4. Run unit/pipeline tests
        ↓
5. Start FastAPI
        ↓
6. Test /health
        ↓
7. Test /api/analyze
        ↓
8. Start frontend
        ↓
9. Test complete UI flow
        ↓
10. Evaluate detector quality

Detector Evaluation

Functional correctness and detector quality are different problems.

The fact that the API successfully returns:

scores
signals
sentences
distribution

does not prove that the detector can reliably distinguish writing patterns.

A proper evaluation should use multiple controlled datasets.

Recommended test groups:

Dataset A — Human-written

Use genuinely human-authored essays.

Dataset B — AI-generated

Use newly generated essays without manually rewriting them.

Dataset C — Mixed

Combine human-written and AI-generated passages.

Dataset D — Edited AI

Use AI-generated writing that has been manually edited.

Compare:

Perplexity
Burstiness
Formulaic phrases
Lexical predictability
Combined score
Flag distribution
Review priority

Do not tune thresholds against a single essay.

Responsible Use

VeritasAI should be used as a review-support system, not as an automatic authorship judge.

Statistical writing characteristics can occur in:

Human writing

AI-assisted writing

Edited writing

Academic writing

Technical writing

Highly polished writing

Non-native English writing

Therefore, a statistical signal should not automatically trigger punishment, rejection, or an accusation of misconduct.

The intended workflow is:

Statistical signal
       ↓
Human review
       ↓
Contextual evidence
       ↓
Informed decision

not:

High score
   ↓
"AI"
   ↓
Automatic rejection

Limitations

VeritasAI has important limitations.

1. Statistical signals are not proof

No individual signal establishes authorship.

2. Short text is unreliable

Short documents contain too few observations for strong statistical interpretation.

The current backend therefore requires a minimum text length for analysis.

3. Perplexity depends on the model

Perplexity values are meaningful only within the context of the language model and configuration used to calculate them.

4. Writing style varies naturally

A person can naturally produce highly predictable, formulaic, or uniform writing.

Likewise, AI-generated writing can be edited to resemble human writing.

5. Thresholds require validation

The score thresholds should be calibrated using representative evaluation data rather than arbitrary assumptions.

License

Add the project's actual license here before publishing the repository.

If the project is not yet licensed, do not claim an open-source license without explicitly choosing one.

Disclaimer

VeritasAI provides statistical diagnostics about writing characteristics.

It does not provide definitive authorship attribution and should not be represented as a system capable of proving that an essay was written by a human or generated by an AI system.

Results should be interpreted as signals for further review, not as definitive conclusions.
