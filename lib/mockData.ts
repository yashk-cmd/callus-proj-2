  title: 'The Intersection of Narrative and Technology',
  processedAt: 'Oct 24, 2024',
  rawText: `The evolution of modern storytelling is intrinsically linked to the platforms that host it. Historically, narrative structures relied on linear progression, carefully designed to guide the audience from an established beginning to a definitive conclusion. However, the digital landscape has fractured this linearity.

Furthermore, it is imperative to consider that the multifaceted dimensions of interactive media facilitate a paradigm shift in user engagement strategies, thereby necessitating a comprehensive reevaluation of traditional pedagogical frameworks. This complexity allows users to become co-creators of the narrative experience.

The resulting tapestry of interconnected storylines provides a rich environment for exploration, though it simultaneously risks alienating participants who prefer a more curated journey. Balancing these competing needs remains a central challenge for contemporary designers.

Ultimately, the successful synthesis of these elements depends on a nuanced understanding of audience psychology. Designers must anticipate diverse pathways while maintaining thematic coherence across all potential interactions. Only then can the true potential of interactive narrative be realized.`,

export const SAMPLE_ESL_ESSAY_TEXT = `When I first moved to the United States for high school, language was my biggest barrier. Firstly, I could not understand the fast speaking of my classmates. Secondly, I struggled with writing essays in English class because my native language grammar is very different. In conclusion, hard work and dedication allowed me to overcome these difficulties.

Furthermore, it is important to state that learning in a foreign environment requires strong determination. I spent three hours every night reading books with a dictionary. Consequently, my vocabulary expanded significantly over two years.`;

Instead of panicking, I grinned. This bug meant my N-body gravity simulation was finally pushing past memory boundaries I hadn't accounted for. Physics doesn't care about your sleep schedule, and that's precisely why I love it.`;
